      <p>Dear world,</p>
      <p>We have entered a challenging time.</p>
      <p>As many of us shift more of our lives to the home over the coming weeks and months, significant challenges are emerging.</p>
      <p>These challenges are impacting us, our family, friends, colleagues and those in our communities.</p>
      <p>It's time to come together (digitally speaking) to solve these new and important problems. This means all entrepreneurs, innovators, engineers, designers, researchers, analysts, everyone!</p>
      <p>We do this in an organised way. With a specified timeframe, and fully online, we focus on the emerging local problems of specific cities. But you can participate from anywhere!</p>
      <p>Individuals and teams are free to form around problems they care about most. Then design, build, launch and share their websites, apps, web services, analyses and other digital solutions!</p>
      <p>The time to act is now. What are you waiting for?</p>
